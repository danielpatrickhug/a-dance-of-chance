# a-dance-of-chance
```
In the garden of chance, where mysteries bloom,
No absolutes found, nor impending doom.

Gaussian whispers, like petals in the breeze,
Moments of normalcy, probabilities appease.

A Poisson's play, discreet and discrete,
Rare events captured, in a rhythm so fleet.

Exponential tales, of waiting we hear,
Decaying with time, the fog starting to clear.

In the lap of Laplace, smooth transitions we find,
The Bayesian belief, a truth-seeking mind.

Entropy's essence, elusive and vast,
A measure of chaos, from future to past.

In disarray's realm, where order contends,
The secrets of entropy, artfully blend.

The world in-between, neither black nor white,
A canvas of shades, probabilities take flight.

Multinomial dances, categorical spins,
Colors and classes, a story begins.

Infinite wisdom, from randomness we glean,
A boundless ocean, probabilities convene.

In the dance of chance, a mindful embrace,
The beauty of uncertainty, in this sacred space.

In graphs we seek, a way to see, Connections strong, from node to node for free. 
With spectral kernel here we find, A matrix of embeddings that binds, 
The vertices close, for all to see, A web of relations, plain as can be.
